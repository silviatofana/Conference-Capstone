# Microverse

> This project is about Microverse which is an online Platform which provides Software Development Course. It was founded by Ariel Camus in 2017 , who is the CEO and Founder of Microverse located in San Francisco, California.
This project is a part of my Microverse curriculum. This is made as Final Project (Capstone), of 1st Module at Microverse in order to attract job opportunities. The main objective is to develop a professional website which showcase my professional skills and also will meet the requirements of a client and be able to meet deadlines.
